# Hey there! I'm Farrel! ðŸ‘‹

**An informatics engineering student in Institut Teknologi Bandung, An aspiring DevOps and Cloud Engineer, and A lifelong learner.**

I enjoy working around the Cloud platform but I try to keep up my knowledge in other fields as well. I'll try to learn new things from various sources like courses, student organizations, committees, and uni lectures.
